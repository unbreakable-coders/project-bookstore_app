## Bookstore App

## Description

The Bookstore App is a full-featured web application designed to support the core operations of an online bookstore. It enables users to browse and search a product catalog, filter items by categories, manage a shopping cart, and complete orders. The system integrates with Supabase to handle data persistence and secure user authentication.
The application is developed using React and TypeScript, following a scalable, component-driven architecture. It leverages Vite and Hot Module Replacement (HMR) to optimize developer productivity and reduce iteration time. The project is intended as a production-ready foundation for small to medium-sized e-commerce businesses.
